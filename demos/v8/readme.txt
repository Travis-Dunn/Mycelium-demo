- New functionality:
    * None - the difference is that this time, the device-specific code is
    loaded dynamically from labelwriter-plugin-1.0.0.jar, rather than statically
    loaded using import statements.

- To run: java -jar MyceliumHub-Phase9.jar

- Test 0 pre-requisite: Same as before, the drivers still need to be replaced.
    However, if you are using the same PC and haven't changed anything, this
    step does not need to be repeated.

- Test 0: Same as before, select the printText command from the dropdown, enter
    something in the "text to print" widget, and press the "print label" button.
    It should print a label.
