- New functionality:
    * Program now has a dropdown menu that shows the commands that the lexicon
        file declares.

- To run: java -jar MyceliumHub-Phase3.jar

- Test 0: Use "Select lexicon file" button to select "sample-lexicon-v2.json"
    - "Device information" pane should display all five attributes as before,
        but also the dropdown menu should populate with the commands.
- Test 1: Select "sample-lexicon-v2-alt.json"
    - Same as with the first lexicon file, but there are two different commands
        this time.
