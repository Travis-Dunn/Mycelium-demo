- New functionality:
    * Now, when you select the printText command, a new type of command panel
        will show up with a text entry field.

- To run: java -jar MyceliumHub-Phase6.jar

- Test 0 pre-requisite: Same as before, the drivers still need to be replaced.
    However, if you are using the same PC and haven't changed anything, this
    step does not need to be repeated.

- Test 0: Same as before, but select 'printText' from the dropdown, and now you
    should see a slightly different panel with a text entry field.
