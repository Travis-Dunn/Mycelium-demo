- New functionality:
    * Now, when you select the printText command, the command panel will have an
        additional, temporary button titled "save test image". When this is
        pressed, the entered text will be rendered as font, and saved to an
        image that can be viewed as a unit test.

- To run: java -jar MyceliumHub-Phase7.jar

- Test 0 pre-requisite: Same as before, the drivers still need to be replaced.
    However, if you are using the same PC and haven't changed anything, this
    step does not need to be repeated.

- Test 0: Same as before, but select 'printText', enter your text, press the
    temporary button, and then open the file, which will appear in the directory
    from which the executable was run, and view the image to verify that it was
    rendered correctly.
